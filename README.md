# CADI ( CODE ACCESS DATA IDENTITY )
			       
## OVERVIEW
  
The purpose of AAF (Application Authorization Framework) is to organize software authorizations so that applications, tools and services can match the access needed to perform job functions.  This is a critical function for Cloud environments, as Services need to be able to be installed and running in a very short time, and should not be encumbered with local configurations of Users, Permissions and Passwords.

To be effective during a computer transaction, Security must not only be secure, but very fast. Given that each transaction must be checked and validated for Authorization and Authentication, it is critical that all elements on this path perform optimally.

AAF contains some elements of Role Based Authorization, but includes Attribute Based Authorization elements as well.
